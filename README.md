# Real-Time-Language-Translator-with-AR-Visualization
This project integrates a Transformer-based model for English-to-Tamil translation with Marker-Based Augmented Reality (AR) using the Vuforia SDK. Speech input is captured using Mozilla DeepSpeech, translated into Tamil, and displayed in real-time as AR overlays on recognized image markers. This pipeline demonstrates seamless integration of NLP, speech recognition, and AR for immersive language translation experiences.
